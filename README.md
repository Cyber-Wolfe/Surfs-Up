# Surfs-Up-

## Overview
An analysis had been run on years of tempertaure data in the months of June and December in Oahu, to determine whether opening a surf shop would be viable year round.

## Results

![Dec Temps](https://github.com/Cyber-Wolfe/Surfs-Up-/blob/main/Captures/Dec%20Temps.PNG)

When viewing the data we have 1700 entries for temperatures in June over 7 years and 1517 entries for December over those 7 years. The data shows that the temperatures are not very far off from each other:
  *  mean, 
  *  standard deviation 
  *  max 

Although the key difference that is strong would be the min temperature is about eight degrees cooler in December than January.
* June 25% - 73
* Dec 25% - 69

* June 50% - 75
* Dec 50% - 71

* June 75% - 77 
* Dec 75% - 74

This is just illustrating out how close the percentiles are to each other and how they don't give us any reason to say June and December aren't essentially the same overall.

## Summary

Oahu in June and in December is essentially showing the same weather with data taken over 7 years.
My advice to the owner after seeing the data is to keep the store open year round as long as finances permit.
